# Agile Principles & My Reflections

## What is Agile?

Agile is a flexible, iterative approach to software development that focuses on delivering value quickly and adapting to change. Unlike traditional project management (like Waterfall), which relies on long-term planning and strict phases, Agile encourages continuous feedback, collaboration, and improvement throughout the development cycle.

## Core Values of Agile (Agile Manifesto)

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a fixed plan


## ðŸ”„ Scrum vs. Kanban (In My Words)

| Aspect        | Scrum                              | Kanban                               |
|---------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Structure     | Time-boxed sprints (e.g. 2 weeks)  | Continuous flow of tasks              |
| Roles         | Defined roles: Scrum Master, PO    | Roles are more flexible               |
| Ceremonies    | Includes sprint planning, review, and retrospectives | Lightweight or no fixed ceremonies   |
| Workload      | Team commits to a set of tasks per sprint | Tasks are pulled as capacity allows |
| Changes       | Changes discouraged mid-sprint     | New tasks can be added anytime        |

### Why Focus Bear Uses Kanban

Focus Bear leans toward **Kanban** because it allows for more flexibility and continuous delivery. Since weâ€™re a small, fast-moving team, being able to adjust priorities quickly and avoid rigid sprint planning works better for how we operate. It also allows interns and part-time contributors to pick up tasks at their own pace without waiting for a new sprint to start.

## Reflection: Benefits & Challenges of Agile

### Benefits:
- Faster feedback and quicker iterations
- Better collaboration between team members
- Easier to adjust to changing requirements
- Focus on delivering real value to users

### Challenges:
- Can feel unstructured if not managed well
- Requires strong communication across the team, which might not be the case at times. 
- Priorities can shift frequently, which may be overwhelming at first

## How Agile Principles Help Me

Agile encourages small, frequent improvements and open communication â€” this helps me learn faster, deliver updates in manageable chunks, and get feedback regularly. It also helps me not feel stuck; even if something doesnâ€™t go perfectly, thereâ€™s always the next task or improvement to work on.

## Summary: Scrum vs. Kanban

**Scrum** is structured with sprints and strict roles, while **Kanban** is more fluid, letting work move through stages continuously. Scrum is great for planning-intensive teams; Kanban works better when you need flexibility â€” like at Focus Bear.

## Agile Principle I Find Most Useful

> "Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage."
(As quoted from the Agile Manifesto)

This principle reminds me that it's okay when things shift. Being able to adapt quickly and focus on what truly helps the user is more important than sticking to a fixed plan.
