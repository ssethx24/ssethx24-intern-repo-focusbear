### Reflection: Why are components important in React?

Components are important in React because they let you split your user interface into smaller, reusable parts. 

Instead of working with one big file, you can build your app from simple building blocks that each handle their own piece of the UI. This makes your code easier to understand, update, and reuse in different places. 

Overall, using components helps keep your project organized and makes it easier to build and maintain even as the app grows. 

NOTE: My application is in my-react-app folder.
