# Professionalism Reflection – Focus Bear

## Professional vs. Unprofessional Behaviour

### Professional (even in a casual work environment):
- Saying “thank you” and acknowledging others' efforts.
- Giving and receiving feedback respectfully and openly.
- Being on time to meetings or giving notice if you’re late.
- Asking thoughtful questions and being honest about blockers.
- Using clear and polite language in messages and PR comments.

### Unprofessional:
- Ignoring messages or ghosting stand-ups.
- Responding with sarcasm or passive aggression.
- Reacting defensively to feedback without understanding the intent.
- Making jokes at someone else’s expense.
- Withholding important information or feedback.



## Respectful Communication in Remote Teams

Respectful communication means:
- Using a friendly tone, even when giving feedback.
- Not assuming negative intent in messages (especially when tone is hard to read).
- Being mindful of differences in working styles or time zones.
- Following up politely if someone hasn’t responded.
- Saying “thanks” or “great job” — little things go a long way.


## Giving and Receiving Feedback

- Focus on **the action, not the person** (e.g., “This function is a bit hard to read” vs. “Your code is bad”).
- **Assume good intent** — most people are trying to help, not criticize.
- Ask for clarification if feedback isn’t clear instead of reacting defensively.
- Say “thank you” when you receive feedback, even if you don’t fully agree — it shows maturity.

## Reflection

### Have you experienced great teamwork or professionalism?

Yes — during a group project, one teammate always acknowledged others’ ideas, gave feedback with kindness, and kept the group focused without micromanaging. It made everyone feel included and motivated.

### Steps I’ll Take for Clear & Respectful Communication

- Use clear subject lines and structured messages (especially in async tools like Slack or Notion).
- Avoid assumptions and double-check tone in written messages.
- Use emojis or friendly phrases to soften tone when needed 🙂.

### How I’ll Help Create a Positive, Fun, and Professional Environment

- Celebrate small wins on Slack or stand-ups.
- Offer help when someone is stuck.
- Don’t take myself too seriously — be open, kind, and collaborative.

### Preparing for Meetings

- Review relevant tasks or updates before the meeting.
- Bring any blockers or questions to discuss.
- Respect others’ time by staying on topic.
- Keep notes and follow up on action items.

### Being Proactive During the Internship

- Regularly update task status (even if it’s “still working on it”).
- Ask questions instead of waiting stuck.
- Offer to help if I finish early or see someone overloaded.
- Follow up on feedback or requests without needing reminders.

### Following Up or Escalating

- If I need a response, I’ll:
  1. Ping the person once politely (e.g., “Just checking in on this – no rush if you’re busy!”).
  2. If there’s still no reply after a couple of days, I’ll ask my supervisor for support.
  3. If it’s an urgent or serious matter (e.g., harassment or breach of conduct), I’ll escalate to the CEO using the phone number in the onboarding deck.

### What I Won’t Do

- I won’t ignore messages or ghost stand-ups meetings. 
- I won’t share internal info externally, even after the internship ends without approval. 
- I won’t blame or shame others in public channels.
- I won’t take feedback personally or respond with sarcasm.
- I won’t use AI tools to handle sensitive content without understanding or approval from my supervisors.
