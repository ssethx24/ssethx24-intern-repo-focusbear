# Cyber Security Guidelines – Focus Bear

## Cyber Security Research

### Common Cyber Security Threats in Remote Work
- **Phishing emails and fake login pages**
- **Weak passwords or reusing passwords**
- **Unsecured Wi-Fi networks**
- **Leaving devices unlocked or unattended**
- **Accidentally pasting sensitive data into public tools or AI models**

### Best Practices for Device & Account Security
- Use strong, unique passwords for each account
- Enable **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** wherever possible
- Use a trusted **password manager** 
- Keep your system and apps updated regularly
- Lock your screen whenever you step away

### Why Locking Your Computer Matters
Leaving your screen open, even for “just a minute,” can expose sensitive company data, client info, or code to others (even at home). Automatic screen lock acts as a simple but powerful barrier.

### Handling Phishing Attempts
- **Never click** on links in suspicious emails
- Check the sender address carefully
- Report the message internally if unsure
- If it feels off — **don’t engage**, double-check with your supervisor

### Strong Passwords & Password Managers
- A strong password is long (12+ characters), with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols
- Don’t reuse the same password across tools
- Use a password manager to generate and store secure logins safely

### Why 2FA Matters
2FA adds an extra layer of security — even if your password is leaked, your account remains protected. Always enable it on:
- Work email
- GitHub
- Slack
- Notion
- Any platform with user or product data

## Reflection

### Security Measures I Already Follow
- I use strong, unique passwords for all my work accounts.
- I’ve enabled 2FA on GitHub and Google.
- I keep my laptop OS and VS Code extensions up to date.

### Where I Can Improve
- I wasn’t consistently using a **password manager**, but I’m now setting one up (Bitwarden).
- I sometimes forgot to lock my screen — now I’ve turned on auto-lock after 3 minutes of inactivity.

### Making Secure Behaviour a Habit
- I’ve added **Focus Bear reminders** to check for updates weekly.
- I’ll treat security like brushing teeth — part of my daily routine.
- I avoid pasting company or user data into AI tools without checking policy.

### Password & Account Security Steps I’m Taking
- Using Bitwarden to store and generate strong passwords.
- Auditing all my work accounts to make sure 2FA is turned on.
- Avoiding the use of personal devices for work unless properly secured.

### What I'd Do If I Suspected a Breach
- Report it **immediately** to my manager or the CEO. 
- Revoke access tokens (e.g., GitHub PATs).
- Change affected passwords and review logs for suspicious activity.

## New Cyber Security Habit I’m Adopting

> I’ve set up my laptop and phone to automatically **lock after 3 minutes** of inactivity. I also manually lock my screen every time I step away — no exceptions.

Cyber security starts with small habits. At Focus Bear, I want to be someone the team can trust to handle data safely and take security seriously.
