# Competitive Landscape – Focus Bear vs Other Productivity Apps

## What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?

Focus Bear stands out because it’s built specifically with **neurodivergent users** in mind — especially those with ADHD or autism. It’s not just a blocker or a timer; it guides users through structured routines, escalates alarms, and integrates habits and focus together in a way that’s both intentional and empathetic. That’s a big difference compared to more rigid or general-purpose productivity apps.

Apps like **Freedom** and **Cold Turkey** focus primarily on **blocking distractions**, while **Tiimo** and **Routinery** help with **routine building**, but not much beyond that. Focus Bear combines both — habit guidance *and* focus support — in one place.

## If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?

I’d choose Focus Bear if I struggled with sticking to routines or needed extra accountability without feeling judged. The way it gently walks you through a routine, gives visual feedback, and escalates alarms feels more like a coach than a blocker.

Also, it feels like Focus Bear “gets it” — especially when it comes to how hard mornings can be, how easy it is to get sucked into distractions, and how real life doesn’t always follow the perfect routine.

## What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?

**Tiimo** has a really clean and customizable visual scheduler that looks more modern and engaging. Its drag-and-drop UI is especially helpful for visual thinkers, which could be something Focus Bear might consider improving in its routine editor.

Also, **Routinery** lets users select from preset routines backed by behavioral psychology — a library of "starter templates" that Focus Bear could potentially add.

## Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?

Focus Bear could benefit from **more personalization in the UI/UX**, especially for users who want to visually structure their day. A more flexible routine planner — possibly with drag-and-drop or color-coded blocks — would make the tool even more intuitive and friendly.

Also, tighter **integration with calendar apps or task managers** (like Google Calendar or Todoist) could help users align their routine with real-world commitments.
