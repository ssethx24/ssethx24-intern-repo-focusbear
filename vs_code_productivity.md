# VS Code Productivity Shortcuts

# Name: Shaurya Seth

As I’m getting started with VS Code, I’ve been exploring some of the most useful keyboard shortcuts to help speed up my workflow. 

Here are my top 10 shortcuts, categorized by how they help during different parts of the development process:


## Navigation

- `Ctrl + P`: Instantly open any file in the workspace without digging through folders.
- `Ctrl + Tab`: Quickly cycle through the files I’ve opened recently.
- `Ctrl + Shift + O`: Jump to a specific function or symbol in the current file—super handy for large files.

---

## Editing

- `Alt + Click`: Add multiple cursors to edit in more than one place at the same time—this one’s a game-changer.
- `Ctrl + D`: Select the next instance of a word or variable to edit multiple at once.
- `Shift + Alt + ↓ / ↑`: Duplicate the current line or selection below or above—great for copying small blocks of code.
- `Ctrl + /`: Toggle comment on the selected line(s)—a daily essential for testing things out quickly.


## Debugging

- `F5`: Start debugging the current project.
- `F10`: Step over to the next line of code without going into functions.
- `F11`: Step into a function to see what’s happening inside.

---

## Terminal

- `` Ctrl + ` ``: Open or hide the built-in terminal without leaving the editor.

# Reflection

### Which shortcuts do I think will be most useful?

I already love using **multiple cursors (`Alt + Click`)** and **select next match (`Ctrl + D`)** for editing similar lines or making batch changes. **File search (`Ctrl + P`)** is another lifesaver—it makes navigating between files feel lightning fast.

Shortcuts like **`Ctrl + /`** and the **terminal toggle** (`` Ctrl + ` ``) are also ones I’ll probably use dozens of times a day.

### How will shortcuts improve my productivity?

Keyboard shortcuts make it easier to stay in flow by removing the constant need to reach for the mouse. 

It might seem like a small thing at first, but these time-savers add up quickly. 

Over time, I have realised that they let me focus more on the code and less on navigating the tools.
