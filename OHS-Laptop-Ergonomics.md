# Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) – Laptop Ergonomics

## Risks of Poor Laptop Ergonomics

Using a laptop without an external monitor or keyboard often leads to poor posture — hunching over the screen, bending the neck forward, and keeping wrists at awkward angles. Over time, this can cause:
- Neck and back strain
- Wrist pain or repetitive strain injuries (RSIs)
- Eye fatigue from poor screen placement
- General discomfort and lack of focus

## Useful Ergonomic Equipment

Some equipment that can make a big difference:
- **Laptop stand**: Raises the screen to eye level to avoid neck strain
- **External keyboard and mouse**: Allow a natural arm position while typing
- **Ergonomic chair**: Supports the spine and encourages proper posture
- **Footrest** (optional): Helps maintain correct leg positioning for shorter people

## Workspace Adjustments I Made

- I placed my laptop on a **stand** to raise it closer to eye level.
- I started using an **external keyboard and mouse** so I could keep my shoulders relaxed and elbows at 90 degrees.
- Adjusted my **chair height** so that my feet are flat on the floor and my back is supported.
- I also made sure my **screen is an arm’s length away**, with the top of the screen at or slightly below eye level.

## Behavioural Changes I’m Implementing

- I now **take short movement breaks every 25–30 minutes** using Focus Bear’s movement reminders.
- I do a quick **posture check** every hour — shoulders relaxed, back straight, and wrists neutral.
- I’ve started using the **20-20-20 rule** for eye strain: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.

## Noticing a Difference

After just one-two hours of these changes:
- My **neck and shoulders felt less tense**.
- The **external keyboard** made typing more comfortable.
- The Focus Bear movement breaks were especially helpful — they reminded me to stretch and reset my posture, which kept my energy up.

## Equipment I Plan to Add

Next, I’d like to invest in a more **ergonomic chair with adjustable lumbar support** — I’m currently using a regular home chair, which works but isn’t ideal for long-term comfort.

## Final Thoughts

Ergonomic improvements don’t need to be expensive — small adjustments and good habits go a long way. Combining those with tools like **Focus Bear’s built-in reminders** helps create a healthier and more focused work environment.
