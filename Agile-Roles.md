# My Role in an Agile Team

## My Role: Front-End Developer Intern

As a front-end developer intern, my main responsibility is to help build and improve the user interface based on design specs and user needs. I contribute by writing clean, accessible, and responsive code using tools like React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also help fix UI bugs, improve performance, and collaborate with designers and back-end developers to ensure the product works smoothly for users.

Even though I’m an intern, I actively participate in the Agile process by picking up tasks from the board, updating progress in stand-ups, and communicating blockers early so that the team can stay on track.

##  Collaboration in Agile (Scrum vs. Kanban)

In **Scrum**, we work in defined sprints with planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives. I contribute by committing to sprint tasks and making sure my UI work fits within sprint goals and timelines.

In **Kanban**, the workflow is more continuous. I would focus on picking up tasks based on priority, moving them through the board, and avoiding unnecessary blockers.

In both, strong communication and clear task tracking are key. I collaborate regularly using tools like GitHub, Notion, or Jira to track my work and stay in sync with the rest of the team.

## Frequent Collaboration: UX Designers

One role I collaborate with often is the **UX/UI Designer**. They provide the design and layout for the components I implement. Good communication helps avoid confusion during hand-off and ensures the final UI matches the design intent.

### How I Can Improve Teamwork:
- Clarify designs early to avoid rework
- Give feedback on what’s technically feasible
- Share small improvements that enhance UX without breaking design consistency

## Frequent Collaboration: Project Manager (PM)

I also work closely with the **Project Manager**, who helps define priorities, plan sprints, and keep the team aligned with overall product goals. They ensure that tasks are well-scoped and that blockers are addressed quickly.

### How I Can Improve Teamwork with the PM:
- Proactively update task progress or delays so they can adjust priorities
- Ask questions if task scope is unclear or if timelines feel tight
- Suggest improvements or flag technical dependencies during sprint planning


Overall, I see my role as a contributor who supports the team by building great UI while communicating clearly with designers, developers, and the project manager. Working closely with others helps me grow faster and ensures the product moves forward smoothly.
