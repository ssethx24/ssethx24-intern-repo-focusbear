# AI Tools Reflection

## Which AI tools did you try?

I tried three AI tools for coding assistance:
- **GitHub Copilot** (inside VS Code)
- **ChatGPT** (through the browser and a VS Code extension)
- **Claude AI** (via claude.ai in the browser)

## What worked well?

- **GitHub Copilot** was great for generating small code snippets on the fly. It felt like autocomplete on steroids — especially helpful for writing utility functions and repetitive logic.
- **ChatGPT** was super useful when I needed to understand new concepts. I asked it to explain things like “debouncing in JavaScript” and “how promises work,” and it gave clear, beginner-friendly answers.
- **Claude AI** really impressed me when I pasted longer blocks of code. It maintained structure and clarity in its explanations, which made it feel less overwhelming when debugging or reviewing.

## What didn’t work so well?

- Copilot sometimes gave incorrect or irrelevant suggestions, especially if the comment wasn’t specific enough.
- ChatGPT can be a bit generic unless you’re clear with your prompt.
- Claude is only browser-based right now — switching between VS Code and the browser wasn’t ideal.

## When is AI most useful for coding?

- When I’m **stuck on a bug** and need a second pair of eyes
- When learning a **new concept or framework**
- For **boilerplate code** or **helper functions** that I don’t want to write from scratch
- When I want to **double-check** that my code is readable and efficient

Overall, AI tools aren’t perfect, but they’re super useful companions — especially when used with good judgment.
