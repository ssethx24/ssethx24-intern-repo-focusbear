# Learning Goals – Front-End Developer Internship- Shaurya Seth 

## What do you hope to learn from this internship?

I hope to get hands-on experience building and improving real web interfaces using React. 

I want to understand how to write clean, efficient code that not only looks good but performs well too. I’m also excited to learn how a frontend team collaborates with product, design, and backend teams to deliver features that users actually need and enjoy using.

## What skills are you most excited to develop?

I'm most excited to level up my React.js and Javascript skills — especially around component design, state management, and working with libraries like Redux and React Router. 

I also want to get more confident with testing, debugging, and optimizing performance. Collaborating on a shared codebase and participating in code reviews is something I really look forward to as well.

## What do you think you can contribute to the team?

I bring strong attention to detail and a real eagerness to learn. I’m comfortable with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and I enjoy turning designs into clean, responsive components. 

I believe I can contribute by being reliable, asking thoughtful questions, and taking ownership of tasks — whether it’s polishing UI, debugging an issue, or just making the user experience a little smoother.

## What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?

One area I’d like to improve is writing tests and debugging more efficiently. 

I’ve done some basic testing before, but I want to understand how to write meaningful test cases and use debugging tools to quickly identify and fix issues in a real-world codebase.

## What does success in this internship look like for you?


Success to me means shipping features that genuinely help users and feeling proud of the code I’ve contributed. It’s also about becoming more confident in a team setting — understanding how agile sprints work, communicating effectively, and learning through regular feedback. 

If I can finish this internship as a more thoughtful and capable front-end developer, that would be a win in itself alongside earning 180+ points and getting a personal recommendation from Jerome would be the cherry on top!
