# Git Knowledge

## Have you used Git before?

Yes, I have used Git before for university projects. 

Iâ€™ve used basic commands like `git clone`, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` while working on repositories.

## Which Git client did you choose and why?

I'm using **VS Code's built-in Git integration** for a long time because it makes it easy to see changes, commit, and push without leaving the editor. 

It also helps visualize diffs and branch status clearly.

## What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?

The most interesting thing I learned is how Git tracks changes in a project over time like a timeline. 

I also found it cool that Git allows you to undo mistakes safely using commands like `git restore` and `git reset`, which can save you when something goes wrong. This is my favourite part of using Git.
