## Reflection

### What steps can I take to ensure data security in my daily tasks?

- Double-check that I’m working in the correct GitHub repo (public vs private)
- Avoid storing hardcoded secrets or user data in local files or shared code
- Use `.env` files for API keys and keep them in `.gitignore`
- Ask before using external tools to process any company or user data

### How should I store, share, and dispose of sensitive information?

- Store: Use secured, company-approved tools (Notion, GitHub, Slack)
- Share: Only with team members who need access, and through secure channels
- Dispose: Delete outdated sensitive info from local storage, and avoid sending it through unsecured mediums (e.g., email, screenshots)

### Common Privacy Mistakes to Avoid

- Copying data into AI tools or public forums without anonymizing it
- Sending screenshots that include personal or sensitive info
- Forgetting to restrict access to internal links or docs
- Committing secrets or credentials to version control

## My Practice for Better Data Security

### Habit I’ll Adopt:
I will **always use `.env` files and Git ignore rules** to keep API keys and credentials out of the codebase — even for local dev projects.

### Key Learning:
> **When in doubt, treat all data as confidential unless confirmed otherwise.**

This mindset helps reduce risk and encourages responsible handling of all information.

Staying privacy-aware isn’t just about rules — it’s about building trust with users and teammates. I want to contribute to that trust by being responsible in how I work, store, and share data.
