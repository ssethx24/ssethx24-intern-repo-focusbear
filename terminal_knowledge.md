# Terminal Knowledge

## Which terminal client did you choose and why?

I'm using **PowerShell inside VS Code** as my terminal client. 
I chose it because it's well-integrated with the VS Code environment, easy to use, and supports all the basic and advanced shell commands I need. 
Plus, I already had it installed, so setup was seamless.

## What customizations did you make?

I haven't made any major customizations yet, but I plan to add some PowerShell aliases soon to speed up frequent Git commands like `git status`, `git commit`, etc. I might also explore PowerShell themes or prompt styling later for better readability.

## What was the most useful command you learned today?

The most useful command I learned was:

- `cd -` – to jump back to the previous directory quickly.
- Also, `ls -Force` (like `ls -a` in bash) helps me see hidden files in the current folder, which is very handy.

I’m starting to see how powerful the terminal can be when you use it efficiently.
