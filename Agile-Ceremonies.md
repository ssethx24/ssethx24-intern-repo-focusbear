# Agile Ceremonies & Team Collaboration

## Agile Ceremonies – Overview

### 1. Daily Stand-ups
Short (usually 10-minute) daily meetings where team members share:
- What they’re working on today
- Any blockers or issues

The goal is to stay aligned, surface problems early, and keep momentum going.

### 2. Sprint Planning (Scrum) vs. Continuous Prioritization (Kanban)
- **Sprint Planning (Scrum):** At the beginning of each sprint (e.g., 2 weeks), the team commits to a set of tasks based on capacity and priorities.
- **Continuous Prioritization (Kanban):** Work is pulled in based on availability and priority. There are no fixed sprints, so prioritization happens on an ongoing basis.

### 3. Retrospectives
A regular team ceremony (often at the end of a sprint) to reflect on:
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items for next time

This helps the team grow and improve over time.

### 4. Backlog Refinement
The team reviews upcoming tasks in the backlog, clarifies requirements, and breaks down work. This ensures the top of the backlog is always ready to be picked up without blockers.

## Async Collaboration in Agile Teams

Agile teams that work across time zones often rely on:
- **Async stand-up tools** (e.g., Slack check-ins, Notion updates, GitHub issue comments)
- **Clear task documentation** and detailed issue descriptions
- **Shared tools** like Jira, Linear, Notion, and GitHub to track work and discussions
- **Flexible meeting windows** with recorded or written summaries so no one misses out

At Focus Bear, async updates via Discord often supplement or replace real-time check-ins when necessary.

## Reflection

### How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?

Agile ceremonies ensure that everyone knows what’s happening, where the blockers are, and how their work connects to the team’s goals. It removes guesswork and encourages feedback loops — especially important when people are working independently or across time zones.

### Which ceremony is most important for my role?

For me, **daily stand-ups** are the most important. As a front-end developer intern, I often work independently on UI tasks, but the stand-up helps me stay in sync with the team, surface blockers early, and ask for help if I’m stuck.

## My Observations

### Attended: Daily Stand-up
I observed how team members quickly shared progress and blockers. It was efficient and helped clarify who was working on what. Even a quick “I’m still working on the same task” gave visibility and context.

### Reviewed: Retrospective Notes
I read notes from a recent retrospective. The team discussed a UI bug that was missed during hand-off. One key takeaway was improving collaboration between devs and designers before marking tasks as "done".

## My Collaboration Improvement

**Change I’m making:** I’ll start dropping async updates in Slack or Notion when I finish a task or encounter a blocker — even if it’s outside of a stand-up time. This will help teammates stay in the loop and reduce delays in feedback, especially across time zones.
