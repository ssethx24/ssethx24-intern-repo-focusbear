# User Manual – Shaurya Seth (Front-End Developer Intern)

## How I Work Best

- I’m most productive when I have **clear tasks and structured goals**.
- I enjoy working independently but also appreciate occasional check-ins or nudges to keep momentum going.
- If I get stuck, I like to **try solving the issue first**, and then ask questions with context.
- I focus best during **quiet, uninterrupted blocks** of time, especially in the mornings.



## How I Prefer to Communicate

- I prefer **async messages first** (Github comments or Discord ), but I’m happy to jump on short calls if needed.
- I value **clarity and context** in messages — bullet points, examples, or links go a long way!
- If something’s urgent, I appreciate a quick ping or tag to help me prioritize.


## Feedback Style

- I prefer **clear, constructive, and actionable feedback** — I don’t take it personally!
- I really appreciate when feedback includes both “what’s working” and “what could be better.”
- Written feedback works best for me (e.g., PR comments), but I’m open to verbal feedback in 1:1s.



## What Helps Me Stay Productive

- **To-do lists and small wins** — breaking work into steps keeps me motivated.
- I have started using Focus Bear to remind me to take breaks and avoid burnout.
- I often listen to **instrumental music** while coding to stay in flow.



## What I Need From Teammates

- Clear task descriptions and expected outcomes
- Friendly reminders if I forget something or miss an update
- Patience if I ask clarifying questions — I like to double-check rather than assume
- Encouragement helps! Even small positive feedback goes a long way.



## Fun Facts & Quirks

- I tend to process ideas better when I write them down first.
- I like organized  docs and clean GitHub issues — a tidy workspace helps me think better.
- I sometimes go quiet when I’m deep in focus — feel free to check in, I’m not ignoring anyone!
