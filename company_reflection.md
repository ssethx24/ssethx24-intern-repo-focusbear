# Company Reflection – Focus Bear

## Why was Focus Bear created?
I believe Focus Bear was born out of the founder Jerome's real frustration: trying to follow a healthy routine but getting stuck in endless scrolling or distracted by notifications. 

It was was built by folks with ADHD and autism who personally experienced these challenges.

## What problem is it solving?
It’s tackling the two biggest hurdles I’ve seen: **staying focused** and **sticking to routines**, especially for neurodivergent people. It locks distractions, guides you through morning routines, and even gives escalating alarms so you’re not late.

## Why is the mission important?
Because consistent routines and focus are hard to build when your brain fights against them. These aren't just productivity tools—they’re lifelines. And the economic and emotional costs of missed deadlines, poor sleep, or burnout are real- missed oppourtunities, losing or getting fired from jobs. 

## How does this align with my values?
I care deeply about tools that support mental well‑being, not just efficiency. Focus Bear’s research-based, caring approach speaks to me. It treats productivity as something humane—not just another checklist.

## Personal connection
I know people who struggle with deadlines and routine—I've seen classmates drop courses because they couldn’t keep up, and friends spiral into late-night scrolling instead of studying, even when they are not neurodivergent. 

A tool like Focus Bear could help them break that cycle by offering gentle structure and real-time guidance.

I’m excited to explore how this app can help not just me, but potentially everyone who’s ever felt stuck in a routine they wanted but couldn’t follow.
