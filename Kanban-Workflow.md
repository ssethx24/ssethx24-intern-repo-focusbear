# Kanban Workflow

## Research & Learn

### How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?

A Kanban board is a visual tool used to manage tasks, track progress, and optimize workflow. It helps teams visualize their work, limit work in progress, and maximize efficiency. Each task is represented as a card, and the board is divided into columns that reflect different stages of the workflow.

### What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent?

Common columns on a Kanban board include:

- **Backlog**: Tasks that are identified but not yet started.
- **To Do**: Tasks that are ready to begin.
- **In Progress**: Tasks currently being worked on.
- **Blocked**: Tasks that are stuck or waiting on something.
- **Review** (optional): Tasks needing approval or verification.
- **Done**: Completed tasks.

### How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?

Tasks move from left to right across the board as they progress through each workflow stage. Team members are responsible for updating the status of their own tasks to reflect real-time progress, ensuring visibility for the whole team.

### What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?

- Reduces context switching.
- Encourages task completion before starting new ones.
- Highlights bottlenecks in the workflow.
- Improves focus and quality.
- Prevents team overload.

## Reflection

### How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?

Kanban provides a clear view of current workload, making it easy to spot overcommitment. By visually limiting the number of active tasks and using WIP limits, teams can maintain focus, complete high-priority items first, and reduce stress from multitasking.

### How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?

- Set clear WIP limits for each stage.
- Use swimlanes or labels to categorize tasks (e.g., urgent, feature, bug).
- Hold regular reviews to reprioritize the backlog.
- Automate status updates using integrations (e.g., GitHub commits).
- Reflect weekly on completed tasks to identify blockers or inefficiencies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Task

### Focus Bear‚Äôs Kanban Board Observation

- Located in **GitHub Projects**. Jeremy showed us in one of the standups. 
- Columns include: Backlog ‚Üí To Do ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Done.
- Tasks are tagged by priority and type (bug, feature, improvement).
- Clear assignment to team members with deadlines.

### Task Movement

‚úÖ Moved task **"Complete induction tasks"** from "To Do" to "In Progress" and updated progress notes.

### Improvement Identified

**Suggestion:** Implement task checklists within cards to break down large items into subtasks for better tracking and smoother review process. Moreover, it needs regular updates for better collabration.
